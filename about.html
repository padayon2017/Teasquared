        <p class="about-p">TEA Squared is a cafe that offers a selection of drinks and food, it is located at Legaspi
          Street, Roxas City. TEA Squared increasingly offers milktea, coffee and variety of bistro food. It started
          with
          the idea of the business owner Engr. Dominique Sapio a civil engineer, having a T-Square (measuring tool)
          which
          she usually uses in her profession. Having a background knowledge in brewing tea and experimenting flavors
          that
          goes along with it. She came up with the idea to open a cafe which is called TEA Squared that serves mainly
          milktea and she continuously added bistro food to her menu to satisfy customers. Up until now the business
          still
          operates with high standards providing quality drinks and superior service in a clean, chill and cozy ambience
          at a great value.</p>
